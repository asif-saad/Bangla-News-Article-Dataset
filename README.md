In total, more than 1.9 million articles from nine Bangla news websites were gathered; the selection process was led by a number of categories, including sports, economy, politics, local news, tech, tourism, entertainment, education, health, the arts, and many more. The dataset per newspaper contains varying attributes, such as title, content, time, tags, meta, category, etc. This dataset will enable data scientists to investigate and assess theories related to Bangla natural language processing. Furthermore, there is a greater chance that the dataset will be utilized for domain-specific large language models in the context of Bangladesh, and it may be used to develop deep learning and machine learning models that categorize articles according to subjects.}
